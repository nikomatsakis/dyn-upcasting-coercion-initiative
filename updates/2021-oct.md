# 2021-Oct: Lang team update

## Summary

* Impl is largely ready
* Blocked on deciding the question of [upcast safety](../design-discussions)

## Goals for this month

* Hold design meeting about upcast safety and reach a conclusion

## Deref coercion

It was discovered in [#89190] that extending "unsizing coercions" to include upcasts can cause deref coercions not to trigger, if those deref coercions "deref" to a `dyn` type. Current plan is to issue future compatibility warnings in [#89461](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89461), since the only known use of this is emulating the upcasting coercion (and hence the code will continue to work afterwards, but the Deref impl is not invoked).
